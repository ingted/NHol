# NHol

### An implementation of higher-order logic (HOL) in F#.

====

## Purpose
The project aims at developing a high-order theorem prover in F#. The goal is to leverage the power of functional programming language F# and .NET platform in an interesting context, automated deduction. At the first step, we would like to bring the core features of [Hol-light](https://code.google.com/p/hol-light/) to F#.
